      <p>Smile and File^ is dedicated to protecting the confidentiality and privacy of information entrusted to it. As part of this fundamental obligation, SMILE AND FILE is committed to the appropriate protection and use of personal information that has been collected online.<br>
      Generally, our intent is to collect only the personal information that is provided voluntarily by online visitors so that we can offer information and/or services to those individuals.</p>
      <p>Kindly review this Privacy Statement (“Privacy Statement”) to learn more about how we collect, use, share and protect the Personal Information that we have obtained.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Collection and use of personal information</strong></p>
      <p>We obtain personal information about you if you choose to provide it. In some cases, you may have previously provided your Personal Information to SMILE AND FILE.<br>
      By registering and/or submitting personal information to SMILE AND FILE, you are also agreeing to the use of this information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Your personal information is not used for other purposes, unless we obtain your permission, or unless otherwise required or permitted by law or professional standards.<br>
      In some cases where you have registered for certain services we may store your email address temporarily until we receive confirmation of the information you provided via an email.<br>
      SMILE AND FILE generally collects only the personal information necessary to fulfill your request. Where additional, optional information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection.<br>
      SMILE AND FILE only collects “sensitive” personal information when the relevant individuals voluntarily provide us with this information or where such information is required or permitted to be collected by law or professional standards.</p>
      <p>Please use your discretion when providing sensitive information to SMILE AND FILE, and under any circumstances, do not provide sensitive information to SMILE AND FILE, unless you thereby consent to SMILE AND FILE’s use of that information for its legitimate business purposes and consent to the transfer and storage of such information to and in SMILE AND FILE databases. If you have any questions about whether the provision of sensitive information to SMILE AND FILE is, or may be, necessary or appropriate for particular purposes, please contact SMILE AND FILE at info@SmileandFile.com.</p>
      <p><strong>1.1 Automatic collection of personal information</strong></p>
      <p>In some instances, SMILE AND FILE and its service providers uses cookies and other technologies to automatically collect certain types of information when you visit us online, as well as through emails that we may exchange. The collection of this information allows us to customize your online experience, improve the performance, usability and effectiveness of SMILE AND FILE’s online presence, and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing activities.</p>
      <p><strong>1.1.1 IP addresses</strong></p>
      <p>An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the internet. It allows computers and servers to recognise and communicate with one another. IP addresses from which visitors appear to originate may be recorded for IT security and system diagnostic purposes. This information may also be used in aggregate form to conduct web site trend and performance analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>1.1.2 Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>Cookies may be placed on your computer or internet-enabled device whenever you visit us online. This allows the site to remember your computer or device and serves a number of purposes.</p>
      <p>On some of our web sites, a notification banner will appear requiring your consent to collect cookies. If you do not provide consent, your computer or internet-enabled device will not be tracked for marketing-related activities. A secondary type of cookie referred to as “user-input” cookies may still be required for necessary functionality. Such cookies will not be blocked through the use of this notification banner. Your selection will be saved in a cookie and is valid for a period of 60 days. If you wish to revoke your selection, you may do so by clearing your browser’s cookies.<br>
      Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can choose whether or not to accept cookies via your browser’s settings (often found in your browser’s Tools or Preferences menu). You may also delete cookies from your device at any time. However, please be aware that if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to fully experience some of our web sites’ features.</p>
      <p>Further information about managing cookies can be found in your browser’s help file.</p>
      <p>Other third party tools and widgets may be used on our individual web pages to provide additional functionality. Use of these tools or widgets may place a cookie on your device to make their service easier to use, and ensure your interaction is displayed on our webpages properly.</p>
      <p>Cookies by themselves do not tell us your email address or otherwise identify you personally. In our analytical reports, we may obtain other identifiers including IP addresses, but this is for the purpose of identifying the number of unique visitors to our web sites and geographic origin of visitor trends, and not to identify individual visitors.<br>
      BY NAVIGATING ON OUR WEB SITES OR ENTERING YOUR LOGIN DETAILS TO ACCESS AREAS RESERVED FOR REGISTERED USERS, YOU AGREE THAT WE CAN PLACE THESE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER OR INTERNET ENABLED DEVICE.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Sharing and transfer of Personal Information</strong></p>
      <p>We do not share personal information with unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary for our legitimate professional and business needs, to carry out your requests, and/or as required or permitted by law or professional standards.</p>
      <p>In some instances, SMILE AND FILE may share Personal Information about you with various outside companies or service providers or vendors working on our behalf to help fulfill your requests.</p>
      <p>In addition, SMILE AND FILE may transfer certain PERSONAL INFORMATION across geographical borders to other SMILE AND FILE member firms or outside companies working with us or on our behalf. SMILE AND FILE may also store PERSONAL INFORMATION in a jurisdiction other than where you are based. By providing PERSONAL INFORMATION on online, visitors are consenting to this transfer and/or storage of their PERSONAL INFORMATION across borders.</p>
      <p>SMILE AND FILE may also disclose PERSONAL INFORMATION in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of the site to which the data relates, in order to respond to requests of government or law enforcement agencies or where this is required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations. These disclosures may also be needed for data privacy or security audits and/or to investigate or respond to a complaint or security threat. SMILE AND FILE does not sell PERSONAL INFORMATION to any third parties. Also, SMILE AND FILE will not transfer the PERSONAL INFORMATION you provide to any third parties for their own direct marketing use.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Choices</strong></p>
      <p>In general, you are not required to submit any PERSONAL INFORMATION to SMILE AND FILE online, but we may require you to provide certain PERSONAL INFORMATION in order for you to receive additional information about our services and events. SMILE AND FILE may also ask for your permission for certain uses of your PERSONAL INFORMATION, and you can agree to or decline those uses. If you opt-in for particular services or communications, such as an e-newsletter, you will be able to unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included in each communication. If you decide to unsubscribe from a service or communication, we will try to remove your information promptly, although we may require additional information before we can process your request.</p>
      <p>As described in “Cookies” above, if you wish to prevent cookies from tracking you as you navigate our sites, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Note, however, that some portions of our sites may not work properly if you elect to refuse cookies.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Data security and integrity</strong></p>
      <p>SMILE AND FILE has reasonable security policies and procedures in place to protect personal information from unauthorized loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Despite SMILE AND FILE’s best efforts, however, security cannot be absolutely guaranteed against all threats. To the best of our ability, access to your personal information is limited to those who have a need to know. Those individuals who have access to the data are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information. We also make reasonable efforts to retain personal information only for so long as the information is necessary to comply with an individual’s request or until that person asks that the information be deleted.</p>

      <p>Please be aware that SMILE AND FILE web sites may contain links to other sites, including sites maintained by other SMILE AND FILE member firms that are not governed by this Privacy Statement but by other privacy statements that may differ somewhat. We encourage users to review the privacy policy of each Web site visited before disclosing any personal information.</p>
